Spike Plan
Project: AI-Powered Resume Builder
Course: CSCI 4391 – Senior Project
Purpose of the Spike

The purpose of this spike is to reduce technical uncertainty surrounding the integration of a 
Large Language Model (LLM) into our AI Resume Builder application.
Because the AI component is the highest-risk portion of the system, this spike will validate 
feasibility before full development begins. Specifically, we will test whether an LLM can 
reliably transform structured user input into professional, concise, and well-formatted 
resume bullet points.
This spike will inform architecture decisions, prompt design strategy, and system 
constraints for the MVP.

Spike Objectives
By the end of this spike phase, we aim to:
Validate that AI-generated resume bullets are professional and structured.
Minimize hallucinations or fabricated achievements.
Determine optimal prompt design for consistent formatting.
Verify backend-to-AI integration feasibility.
Estimate response latency and API cost per request.

Spike Scope 
This spike will focus only on AI validation and backend feasibility.
Out of scope for this phase:
Frontend UI development
Authentication
Resume export functionality (PDF/Docx)
Styling and visual polish

Spike 1: Resume Bullet Generation Feasibility
Objective
Evaluate whether an LLM can convert informal or structured job descriptions into 
professional resume bullet points.
Key Questions
Can the model generate strong action-oriented bullet points?
Does the output remain concise (1–2 lines per bullet)?
Is formatting consistent across responses?
Does the model fabricate information not provided?
Method
Develop multiple structured prompt variations.
Test 10–15 representative user inputs, including:
Student with limited experience
Retail job experience
Internship experience
Technical project description
Compare outputs for clarity, tone, and structure.
Deliverables
Finalized prompt template
Input/output comparison samples
Documentation of observed limitations
Success Criteria
Bullet points begin with strong action verbs.
No fabricated achievements.
Consistent formatting across test cases.
Minimal manual editing required

Spike 2: Tone & Experience-Level Adaptation
Objective
Test whether the model can adjust tone and complexity based on user-selected 
experience level.
Key Questions
Can the AI differentiate between student and entry-level tone?
Does it maintain professionalism?
Does tone adjustment introduce hallucinations?
Method
Modify prompts to include experience-level parameters.
Generate outputs across multiple scenarios.
Compare tone consistency and realism.
Deliverables
Prompt modification strategy
Output comparison documentation
Decision on supported tone options for MVP
Success Criteria
Clear tone distinction between experience levels.
Professional formatting maintained.
No fabricated data introduced
