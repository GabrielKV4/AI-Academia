Section 1 – Problem + Target Users
Many college students and early-career job seekers struggle to create effective, professional resumes due to having limited work experience,
lack of guidance, and difficulty translating academic or extracurricular experiences into professional language. 
These challenges are even more significant for students with learning disabilities such as ADHD or dyslexia, who may face additional barriers in organizing information.
As a result, qualified students may be overlooked in competitive job markets, limiting their access to internships and early career opportunities.
The goal of Academia AI it to improve equitable access to academic and career success by providing a tool to support resume creation, skill translation, and effective study habits. 

Section 2 – Goal / Success Metrics
Study Material Accuracy
The system will correctly summarize at least 80% of identified “important information” from source materials.
Accuracy will be measured by comparing AI-generated summaries against marked key points.

Resume Quality Improvement
Generated or improved resumes produced by the application will be scored by free resume scanning tools and must achieve a score of at least 75% or higher.

Section 3 – MVP User Stories
-	As a recent graduate, I want to upload my existing resume, so that I can improve its clarity and professionalism.
-	As a student with ADHD, I want structured and simplified resume suggestions, so that organizing my ideas feels less overwhelming.
-	As a college student, I want to enter my education, skills, and experience, so that I can quickly generate professional bullet points.
-	As a job seeker, I want to upload my existing resume, so that the system can suggest stronger, ATS-friendly language.
-	As a student, I want to upload a class PDF, so that I can receive a clear study guide summarizing the most important information.

Section 4 – MVP Scope vs. Non-Goals
The Minimum Viable Product will consist of a simple web-based application with a functional graphical user interface that allows for users to enter resume information and upload documents.
The frontend will contain fields that allow for education, skills, and work experience to be entered while the backend will use a lightweight API framework such as 
Flask or FastAPI to process user input and communicate with a pre-trained LLM through an external API. 
The resume feature will allow users to enter basic information or upload an existing resume. The system will generate structured resume bullet points,
professional summaries, and reword content to improve clarity and impact. The application will also suggest Applicant Tracking System (ATS) friendly keywords
to help users improve compatibility with automated resume screening systems. Users will retain full control over the final content and may edit generated material before exporting it.
For the academic support side, users will be able to upload PDF study materials from their classes. The system will extract the text and
generate shortened bullet-point summaries that highlight key concepts. Generated summaries will then be able to be downloaded as a PDF to assist with exam preparation.
Non-Goals
The MVP will not include automated job application submission or AI-driven hiring decisions. Advanced analytics and integrated ATS scoring withing the application
are all outside the scope of the initial release. The MVP will be purely web-based and will not offer a dedicated mobile application variant. 

Section 5 – Acceptance Criteria
Resume Generation Feature
The system will allows the user to enter education, skills, and work experience information and generate structured resume bullet points in a professional tone.
The system shall produce resume content within 15 seconds of submission under normal operating conditions. The system shall allow users to edit generated content before exporting.
The system shall successfully export the final resume as a downloadable PDF file. The system shall handle incomplete input fields by generating output only from provided data without crashing.
The system shall fail safely by displaying an error message if the AI API call fails rather than freezing.
Study Guide Summarization Feature
The system shall allow users to upload a PDF containing class study material. The system will extract text and generate a bullet-point summary highlighting key concepts.
The system will produce the summarized study guide within 15 seconds under normal conditions. The generated summary shall include at least 75% of marked “important information” when evaluated.
The system will export the summarized study material as a downloadable PDF.

Section 6 – Assumptions + Constraints
The system assumes the user will provide accurate and complete resume information and readable PDF study materials. Output quality depends on the clarity of the user input.
The system relies on pre-trained generative AI API and does not train its own model. Users are responsible for reviewing and approving all generated content before use.
The system will only process user-provided text and uploaded PDFs and will not access external databases or store personal data long-term. The application must operate within API rate limits,
token limits, and cost constraints of third-party AI services. AI functions strictly as an assistive tool and will not automate hiring decisions or fabricate user qualifications.
