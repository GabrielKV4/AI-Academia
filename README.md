Roles:
Daniel-HTML Architect
Francisco- AI Lead
Liliana-UI/UX Designer
Gabriel- Project Manager

Problem:
- Too many people are applying for jobs, and they are not getting any interview opportunities
- Many of these candidates' resumes are not making it past the initial resume scanner
- The problem is that their resumes do not contain the correct verbiage or keywords to make it past that step.

Solution:
- Our application will use AI to reword the user's experience in more action-based verbiage
- It will also try to incorporate AI-friendly keywords where they are applicable

Target Users
- Our ideal users are recent college graduates who might not have a lot of experience
- They would need a tool like this the most

Requirements:
- GUI to upload resume
- Call to AI for analysis
- Output the suggested changes ranked by most impactful to least impactful
- Highlighting of the AI keywords

Testing:
- We will use free resume grading sites to test the score before and after the changes have been made

Beyond "AI Wrapper"
- The UI will highlight keywords in the resume: green = strong, yellow = weak, red = needs removal
